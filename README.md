# Playground

This is the [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) application which I use as a playground
for exploring new client and server projects as well as upgrades to the Rails stack.

## ToDo

- [ ] Convert request spec to new rspec [feature/scenario dsl](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec)
- [ ] Add [degrade](https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade) to gracefully rollback failing features
- [x] Add [rollout](https://github.com/bitlove/rollout) and [rolloutui](https://github.com/jrallison/rollout_ui) to control feature deployments
