# Playground

This is the [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) application which I use as a playground
for exploring new client and server projects as well as upgrades to the Rails stack.

## ToDo

* Convert request spec to new rspec [feature/scenario dsl](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec)
